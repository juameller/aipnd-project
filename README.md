# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

In order for the program to run, **you need to download the data from https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/flower_data.tar.gz**
After downloading the data, make sure to **rename** the folder from flower_data to flowers (or change the code in the notebook accordingly).
